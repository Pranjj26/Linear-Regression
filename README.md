# Linear Regression Project README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis using Python and popular data science libraries. Linear regression is a powerful statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

In this project, we use a dataset named "Ecommerce Customers" to predict the yearly amount spent by customers based on various factors such as average session length, time spent on the app and website, and the length of membership. We will walk you through the essential steps, from data exploration to model evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the linear regression analysis.
- `Ecommerce Customers`: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb`) using your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook itself.
3. Ensure you have the dataset file named `Ecommerce Customers` in the same directory as the notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to follow the linear regression analysis process.
2. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code cell to help you understand the workflow.

## Exploring the Data

We start by exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents:

- Loading the dataset using Pandas.
- Displaying basic statistics and information about the data.
- Plotting graphs to visualize the relationships between variables.

## Linear Regression Model

The main part of the project involves building and training a linear regression model to predict yearly spending:

- Splitting the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
- Creating a linear regression model using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.
- Fitting the model to the training data.
- Making predictions using the test data.
- Evaluating the model's performance by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

- Visualizing the model's predictions against the actual test data.
- Displaying the model coefficients and their interpretations.
